# On the Equivalence between Positional Node Embeddings and Structural Graph Representations

## Overview:
This is the code for [On the Equivalence between Positional Node Embeddings and Structural Graph Representations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJxzFySKwH).

We evaluate different models on the node classification, link prediction and triad prediction tasks

Please see the supplementary section for a brief description and summary of the code. 

## Requirements
* PyTorch 1.2.0 or later - which can be downloaded [here](https://www.pytorch.org)
* Python 3.6.1
* Pytorch-geometric - which can be downloaded [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)


We recommend training these models on a GPU.


Cora and Pubmed are described in Sen et al., 2008, and PPI in Zitnik and Leskovec, 2017.  They are described in Hamilton 2017.
Please see [our paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJxzFySKwH) for further details, including our test/train/validation splits.
